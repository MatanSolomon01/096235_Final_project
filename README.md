## Structure
Welcome to our _Intelligent Interactive Systems_ final project repo.

Here you can find all the milestones of the project in a one place.

**TL;DR** - The folder `My kitchen companion` contains the
prototype and all the relevant things for _Milestone 4_.
So you can start from the README file there instead of keep
reading.

The other folders contain the project proposal (_Milestone 1_),
interface and algorithms description (_Milestone 2_), 
the presentation in class (_Milestone 3_), and the original 
project instructions. We used this repo during our work on 
the project, and we decided to leave it as a legacy structure.
